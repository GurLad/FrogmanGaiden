Story:
People who die are reborn as mindless monsters from the Magma. A group of people, the Guards, kills the monsters to prevent them from getting to the surface. However, a lucky few found a Magma Emblem: an emblem that, when worn, lets them keep their mind and identity when they return from the Magma (they still turn into monsters, however). Frogman is one of them. He finds a few other people with Magma Emblems and, together, they try to escape the other monsters, the Guards and the Magma. However, there is one other force in play: The Blue Fireball of Torment (TBFOT). A sinister blue fireball, he sows chaos in the underground, helping the Magma Emblemers by giving them powerful weapons, but at the same time torturing them by throwing monsters at them.
TBFOT is the final boss, as by escaping the underground, the Magma Emblemers accidently set it free as well.
Gameplay:
The game has three areas. Each run, there are three rooms in each area: 2 normal rooms, where you get a random character, and a boss room, where you (obviously) fight a boss. In addition, after each boss, there is a special TBFOT encounter, where you get a weapon. The first area has mostly monster enemies, and the boss is a random powerful monster. The second area has both monsters and Guards (who fight each other as well as you), and the boss is a certain Guard captain with a Magma Emblem (they eventually join you after you kill them the first time and they turn into a monster, and the boss becomes a random generic Guard captain). The third room is the Guard headquarters on the surface and has only Guard enemies. The boss there is a king/angel/legendary warrior, who fights you alone (think FE7 Red Dragon). Afterwards, TBFOT betrays you, and you have to fight his minions for 2 rooms before engaging the true final boss: TBFOT itself.
Mechanics:
-After each room, you choose one of three random possible level ups for each character. All level ups increase exactly three stats, and the probabilities are determined by character. Monsters auto-level to (target-1) level by fixed probability based levels, and one random level.
-Each weapon has an innate ability that all wielders of that weapon share.
-Classes only affect enemies (growth rates), and have no abilities.
-There is "perma-death", as in when a character dies, they leave you for the current run. The only thing saved between runs are weapons, which you get from TBFOT battles.
Game types:
When you create a new save, you choose three things:
-Mode:
--Roguelike: default, as described above
--Classic: FE-like. There are 12 chapters + TBFOT endgame, which are essentially handpicked rooms and conversations. True perma-deaths, and when Frogman dies, return to save.
--PvP: One player plays the Guards and the other monsters. Start at area 2, and whenever the Guards win move towards 1, and when the monsters win towards 3 (~2 wins for an area change). Only the surviving lord (random character) is saved between battles and levels up. The run ends when a side wins twice in their opponent's area, and a new game can then begin.
-RNG-system:
--RNG: default, 1.5RN for hits.
--Hybrid: 50% of using Luck system, 50% of 1.5RN. Luck is always between 0-99.
--Luck: Each character has a luck stat (starts at 50 each battle). Whenever they try to hit, increase it by the percent. If it's above 100, reduce it by 100 and the attack hits. Otherwise, it misses.
-Difficulty:
--Easy: Your units start with an extra level, enemies can't have skills (as in the innate ability that all wielders of a certain type of weapon share).
--Normal: Default, only enemy bosses have skills.
--Hard: Enemies start with an extra level, all enemies have skills (mainly annoying and has memory issues, so perhaps not).

Alternate combat system:
Replace Pierce with Skill, as Pierce might make defensive strategies unviable. If the attacker (check for them only) has higher skill than the target, they can't counter. Damage is just "Weapon power + user strength - target defense(/2 maybe)".

AI:
Overview of current and future AI types:
Each unit has their AI written in their status page. Each AI also has a priority.
I originally thought of some AI ideas a few weeks ago, but forgot to write it down, so I forgot most of my ideas by now.
-Monster (basic) AI:
--Charge:
  If there is no enemy in range, find the closest enemy, and find the quickest way to reach them. Otherwise, use Hold AI.
--Hold (pretty bad name):
  Don't move unless there is an enemy in range. If there is one, find the one who this unit deals the most damage to, and attack it
  from favorable terrain (if possible).
--Guard:
  Don't move. If there is an adjacent enemy, attack the one this unit deals the most damage to.
-Guard AI:
 Generally smarter and more team-based. Should use strategies such as flanking, baiting, holding choke points etc.
 This may require an AI overhaul, with a team-based AI function instead of unit-based one.
 Most AI types will be part of a group/under the same commander, who will always work together.
 I will write more options as I think of concrete algorithms to describe them.
--Group bait:
  Similar to hold, but only attack the enemy if at least X units can also attack it this turn. Otherwise, retreat to just outside the enemy's range.
--Group charge:
  Similar to charge, but all units in the group choose the same uni to attack, even if some of them end up in unfavorable terrain because of that
  or can't reach them in the same turn. Could also make it like Bait, where at least X units must be able to attack that unit.

Alternate Torment levels palette:
Torment, as a character, is mostly cyan-bright cyan. Since no team uses these colors, and with the, being th final boss, it's weird that they're red in-game.
In addition, the Guards boss and Torment should be able to appear at the same time, so using the Guard's palette is problematic.
Here are a couple of solutions, each with their own problems, sorted from easiest to implement to hardest.
1.  Use the Guard's palette:
    This technically has zero problems now, as the only Torment level contains zero guards, but will become very problematic in the future.
    Pros:
    -Zero coding or changes - simply change their team and the name during Torment levels (already done).
    -Most mechanics just work - all palette changing works as expected, and so will future mechanics.
    -No undesired changes - the game already assumes that the Guard palette exists, so it doesn't affect other graphics.
    Cons:
    -Can't have Torment and Guards in the same room - which is very problematic for the future.
    -No current Guard support - while I could hardcode a simple solution, it kind of removes the main advantage of this method - works immediately in the short term.
2.  Change the monsters palette color (current):
    Simply change the red colors in the PaletteController to cyan ones.
    Pros:
    -Minimal coding - only a few lines. Besides being quick & lazy, it keeps the code simple & clean with few hardcoded 'if's and such.
    -Most mechanics just work - all palette changing works as expected, and so will future mechanics.
    -Immediate guard support - as it doesn't affect them at all.
    Cons:
    -Lots of undesired changes - from changing stat colors to completely wrecking portraits, it ruins many details, without the charm of, say, Kirby's Adventure's palette swapping.
2a. Also change Torment's color:
    It has the same pros and cons from before, but changing red to yellow or pink for example will not be as bad.
3.  Create a complicated system that constantly shifts palettes:
    I rarely use all four palettes outside of the map, so constantly switching palettes depending on the needs of the moment will probably work.
    The only problematic place I can think of is having Player, Torment and Guard characters in the same room and a speaking character that uses the gray palette.
    Pros:
    -If done correctly, will solve all problems - no undesired changes and supports Guards.
    Cons:
    -Hard and complicated to implement - the only I can think of right now to do that is simply add tons of 'if's to lots of scripts.
    -Messes up the code - the above method will make the code unreadable, hard to maintain and easily breakable.

On the outside world:
Characters come from many different eras (and are mostly unaware of that). Here are some details about the world in different eras.
-Before recorded history:
 Torment was free, terrorizing the people with various monsters, and resurrecting the dead as more monsters. Eventually, a group of people managed to seal it.
 These were the ancestors of Marcus, the boss of Part 3. Magic was rampant during that era, directly related to Torment (see On Magic).
-Ancient Era (Xirveros, Firbell):
 The world was mostly divided into different kingdoms. Each kingdom was rules by a very traditional and zealous royal family.
 The kingdoms always fought each other in terrible wars, eventually ruining every single kingdom.
 Xirveros is from the beginning of this era, while Firbell was one of the last royals of Irenhold, one of the last three kingdoms.
 -Kingdoms (as of Firbell's time):
  -Abenzon:
   Abenzon was the largest kingdom. It mostly focused on commerce and peaceful negotiations. Secretly, it arranged to assassinate the royal families of the other kingdoms,
   blaming the other one each time, hoping it would lead them to destroy each other and allow Abenzon to rule the world.
  -Irenhold:
   Irenhold was the oldest surviving kingdom, being there from the very beginning of recorded history. It mostly focused on science and military. Incredibly arrogant, the
   royals of Irenhold considered themselves better than the other kingdoms, even when their own kingdom was on the verge of collapse.
   The night Firbell died, most of the Irenhold royals were assassinated in a coup arranged by Abenzon. Firbell obviously is unaware, as she was the only one with a
   Magma Emblem: Irenhold's national treasure, gifted to her by her mother the queen, Kirmella, once she came of age (Firbell was the heir to the kingdom).
   Xirveros also originated from Irenhold (as you can see from his name), about 100 years before Firbell was born, and originally created the Magma Emblems.
   Only two were ever made - one for him and another was gifted to Irenhold's royal family - and the secret of making them was thought lost throughout the Ancient Era.
  -Enkeros:
   Enkeros was the smallest kingdom, uninterested in outside politics, and mostly focused on art and culture. After the assassination of Irenhold's royal family,
   Enkeros surprised Abenzon by launching a surprise attack on it along with the remaining royals of Irenhold. They managed to destroy Abenzon, but shortly after
   attacked each other, and the remaining royals were killed by an uprising of the starving citizens who were tired of the constant wars.
 -Naming:
  People had only a first name, along with a descriptor of their origin kingdom.
  For example, Bob from Irenhold would be called Irbob, and Tim from Abenzon would be called Abtim.
  Royal or important people also had a title before their name, signifying their importance/royal blood.
  For example, princess Bell from Irenhold would be called F-Ir-Bell, aka Firbell. King Roy of Enkeros would be called K-En-Roy, aka Kenroy.
  Titles (that are used in Frogman Gaiden):
  -X: An honorific title given to important non-royals (like war heroes, scientists, artists ec.) by royals (ex. Xirveros).
  -M: A member of the royal family, but without an official title (siblings of the king, and all princes/princesses besides the heir).
  -F: The current heir to the throne (ex. Firbell).
  -K: The current king/queen (ex. Kirmella).
-Some more eras TBA
-Modern Era (Kresla):
 Start of an industrial resolution-like age. No gunpowder yet, but early signs of modern science (as much as it's possible in a fantasy world)
 and early steam-based machines. The Ancient Era was all but forgotten, but some remnants are still present - for example, many common names begin with K, like Kresla,
 as these are still remembered as king's/queen's names.

On Magic:
Magic is essentially the act of becoming an extension of Torment: the source of all magic. Magic is necessarily destructive, and inflicts the same amount of pain on
the wielder as it would cause. Therefore, it's used mostly as a weapon, and an inefficient one at that. While Torment was free, it was pretty much the only weapon
available to humanity (Torment feeds on the pain of their minions as well as the caster), so it was used extensively. Over time, as more efficient weapons were made,
magic lost its use, eventually being all but forgotten.
Xirveros is from a time when wizards still existed, and was the only wizard who managed to find a non-destructive use for it (although still a pain-inducing one).
It could be the reason he went mad (experiencing the pain of all Magma Emblemers).

Story, expanded:
-Part 1: Monsters (name not final)
 Not much happens besides what's already in-game: Player discovers Firbell, Xirveros and Kresla; Finds the first boss (Lich); and discovers Torment.
-Part 2: Monsters & Guards (see above)
 First two levels: Introductions to the Guards, fighting both monsters and Guards at the same time.
 Level 3: The boss is a living Guard with a Magma Emblem. Once the player defeats them, they can be recruited in Part 3 as a monster (the player chooses whether to
 help them or not). Afterwards, it becomes random generic Guard captains.
 Level 4: Another Torment battle. They tell the player that they are sealed, and should the player free them, they will let Frogman and co. go.
-Part 3: Guards (see above)
 First two levels: Incredibly difficult battles, against the most elite Guards there are. The last 3 playable characters are extremely powerful as well (one is a Lich,
 another is Part 2's boss as a monster, and one more), as they have little to no customization.
 Level 3: Here the player fights the other final boss & main antagonist: Marcus Marcus (maybe change the family name, but I like it). This is a solo battle against him,
 a FE7 Red Dragon-esque finale. Once the player defeats Marcus, Torment shows up and asks Frogman to finish Marcus, and in return Torment will let them go. Should the
 player agree, Torment will betray them after Marcus dies (Cyan will betray you~) and kill them, followed by their return to the world and destructon of humanity.
 Should the player refuse, they will fight Torment itself (and their minions of course), in the true final battle. Once the player wins, they have the choice of sparing
 Torment. Should they spare them, Torment will do what they agreed at the start, letting Frogman and co. return to the world (as monsters), while Torment remains sealed.
 Should the player decide to kill them, Torment will fight again (pathetically weak this time), and once killed, Marcus will intervene and lay the final blow. This will
 cause Torment to truly die, all magic and monsters disappear, and all the Magma Emblemers immediatly die forever.

Knowledge:
Knowledge should make the game more interesting as time goes by, not simply easier. Good knowledge upgrades give players more choices/strategies. Bad ones increase stats.
Currently, knowledge effects are hardcoded (may change that in the future, although may be too complicated).
Sample knowledge upgrades (pretty much ToDo):
 -Increase the amount of available level-ups (start at 1/2, upgrade to 3).
 -Inclination offensive buff (unavailable at first).
 -Change Frogman's inclination.
 -Change X's inclination (requires an event with X to unlock).
 -Offering to Torment - your units take 1 damage after each turn in Torment levels, but Torment minions have -1 levels.
 -Deny Torment - your units heal 1 HP after each turn in Torment levels, but Torment minions have +1 levels.
