Story:
People who die are reborn as mindless monsters from the Magma. A group of people, the Guards, kills the monsters to prevent them from getting to the surface. However, a lucky few found a Magma Emblem: an emblem that, when worn, lets them keep their mind and identity when they return from the Magma (they still turn into monsters, however). Frogman is one of them. He finds a few other people with Magma Emblems and, together, they try to escape the other monsters, the Guards and the Magma. However, there is one other force in play: The Blue Fireball of Torment (TBFOT). A sinister blue fireball, he sows chaos in the underground, helping the Magma Emblemers by giving them powerful weapons, but at the same time torturing them by throwing monsters at them.
TBFOT is the final boss, as by escaping the underground, the Magma Emblemers accidently set it free as well.
Gameplay:
The game has three areas. Each run, there are three rooms in each area: 2 normal rooms, where you get a random character, and a boss room, where you (obviously) fight a boss. In addition, after each boss, there is a special TBFOT encounter, where you get a weapon. The first area has mostly monster enemies, and the boss is a random powerful monster. The second area has both monsters and Guards (who fight each other as well as you), and the boss is a certain Guard captain with a Magma Emblem (they eventually join you after you kill them the first time and they turn into a monster, and the boss becomes a random generic Guard captain). The third room is the Guard headquarters on the surface and has only Guard enemies. The boss there is a king/angel/legendary warrior, who fights you alone (think FE7 Red Dragon). Afterwards, TBFOT betrays you, and you have to fight his minions for 2 rooms before engaging the true final boss: TBFOT itself.
Mechanics:
-After each room, you choose one of three random possible level ups for each character. All level ups increase exactly three stats, and the probabilities are determined by character. Monsters auto-level to (target-1) level by fixed probability based levels, and one random level.
-Each weapon has an innate ability that all wielders of that weapon share.
-Classes only affect enemies (growth rates), and have no abilities.
-There is "perma-death", as in when a character dies, they leave you for the current run. The only thing saved between runs are weapons, which you get from TBFOT battles.
