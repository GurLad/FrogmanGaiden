Torment|???: Welcome, welcome! This is Frogman Gaiden!
Frogman: Huh? Who are you?
Torment|Tori: I am... uh... Tori! Yes, Tori! Heh!
I will teach you how to play!
Frogman: Play? What are you talking about?!
Torment|Tori: I'm not talking to you Frogman, but to YOU!
Yes, you! In front of the screen!
Frogman: What?!
Torment|Tori: Oh, shut up already! Anyway, you play as
Frogman here.
Try selecting him by pressing [AButton].
:tutorialShowMarker:5,4
:tutorialForceButton:A:5,4:-2
Excellent! You see those green squares?
Those are places Frogman can move to.
Frogman: Do I have a say in this?
Torment|Tori: Of course not! Ha ha!
Frogman: Well, I refuse to move for you!
Torment|Tori: Oh, really? Let's see you try that!
Move away from the goblin.
:tutorialShowMarker:4,6
:tutorialForceButton:A:4,6:-2
Frogman: Ahhh!
Torment|Tori: Ha ha ha! What a fool! As if you are free...
But running away is no solution! You must
fight your enemies!
Frogman: Why are they my enemies?
Torment|Tori: I'm not going to spoil the story here...
But it's not like you have a choice! Heh!
Start by undoing your last move with [BButton].
:tutorialForceButton:B
Excellent! Now move near the goblin!
:tutorialShowMarker:8,6
:tutorialForceButton:A:8,6:-2
Frogman: But I like goblins!
Torment|Tori: Then you're a fool! Heh heh!
Anyway, where were we? Ah, right. Do you see
those gray squares?
They are places you can attack!
The red characters are your enemies - you
must kill them all!
Frogman: What squares? And I don't want to fight!
Torment|Tori: How many times do I need to tell you?
I'm not talking to you, Frogman!
*sigh* Just attack this Goblin now.
:tutorialShowMarker:8,8
:tutorialForceButton:A:8,8:-2
Torment|Tori: Yes! YES! Bring the PAIN!
I mean, you are great at following orders!
Frogman: Thank you... As if I have a choice...
Torment|Tori: Stop that! Anyway, now the Goblin will
attack you. Good luck!
Frogman: What?!
:wait:turn:>1
Torment|Tori: Wow! Incredible! Sublime! Excellent!
You slew this Goblin with amazing skill!
Frogman: But now I'm hurt!
Torment|Tori: Oh, get over it. You can't heal anyway.
Frogman: What?! I'm doomed to stay injured forever?!
Torment|Tori: Yes! Heh! This is how this game works!
At least, until you finish the level...
Frogman: You keep saying nonsense!
Torment|Tori: Well, that was the tutorial!
It's pretty basic, but you should be able to
figure out the rest.
Frogman: Who are you talking to?!
Torment|Tori: I should probably wipe Frogman's memory
before you begin.
Frogman: Stop ignoring me!
Torment|Tori: And... Done!
Frogman: Where am I? Who are you?
Torment|???: Ha ha ha! Goodbye, and good luck! Have fun!
