Guard1: Ah... The good ol' magma. Been too long
since my last battle.
Guard2: It's... It's so hot! How can you even
fight in here?
Guard1: Don't worry, kid. You'll get used to it.
Just swim in there a bit more!
Guard2: What? Swim in the magma?!
Guard1: Of course! Why, don't you youngsters do it?
How can you fight without knowing how
to swim im magma?
Guard2: But i-it's dangerous!
Guard1: Are you this cowardly?
Back in my day, EVERY- ONE swam in magma!
Guard2: But-
Guard1: No buts! After this battle, you'll go for
a swim!
Guard2: A-all right...
