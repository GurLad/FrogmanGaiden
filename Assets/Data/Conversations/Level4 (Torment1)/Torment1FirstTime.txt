You are so foolish! Please, do go on!

Frogman: Who are you?! What is going on?!

Torment|???: Why, I suppose I haven't introduced
myself yet!
Who am I? Such a deep question! Heh heh!
I am... pain. Fear. Despair.
I am your life, and your death.
Undeath, as well.
I am your magic. Your god.

Frogman: Huh... Huh... Is it... over?
Torment: Oh! Exquisite! Fantastic! Beautiful!
You truly are the champion I've been
looking for!
Frogman: Chamion?! Are you crazy?!
We would never help the likes of you!
Torment: Oh, really? Try again!
Frogman: AHHHHHHH!
AHHHHHHH!
AHHHHHHH!
...
Torment: Now, now. I'm not cruel. Ha.
Actually, I am, but that's not important.
We both seek the same thing, see?
Getting out of here. I'm trapped, like you
So we could just help each other, yes? Heh.
Frogman: How can you help us? Why would you?
Torment: You... aren't very smart, are you? Heh!
I just told you why! As for how...
I still have some power here.
I can give you weapon- s. Supernatural ones.
