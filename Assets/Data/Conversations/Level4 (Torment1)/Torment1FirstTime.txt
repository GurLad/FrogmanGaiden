Torment: Oh! Exquisite! Fantastic! Beautiful!
# TODO: Remove the champion reference. This shuld only be mentioned during Part 2.
You truly are the champion I've been

Frogman: Chamion?! Are you crazy?!
We would never help the likes of you!

Frogman: AHHHHHHH!
AHHHHHHH!
AHHHHHHH!

I just told you why! As for how...
