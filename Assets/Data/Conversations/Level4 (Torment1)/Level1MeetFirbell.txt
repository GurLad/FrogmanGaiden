Firbell|???: I have not seen you before.
Are you new here?
Frogman: Yes? What is this place?
Firbell|???: Ah. First of all, do not panic.
You are dead.
Frogman: What?!
Firbell|???: Do you remember your previous life?
Frogman: No...
Firbell|???: Quite common. You seem to have a weapon.
Let us defeat these monsters, and
then we can have a proper conversation.
Firbell: My name is Firbell, by the way.

Frogman: We won... What were those things?
Firbell: Dead people. Like us. But less lucky.
Frogman: What do you mean? They were mindless beasts!
Firbell: Do you have an Emblem on you, perhaps?
Frogman: Huh? Ah... maybe? Wait, yes, here.
:showImage:Emblem
Firbell: Yes, of course. I have one too.
So do all sapient beings here.
Your memory will return soon.
Frogman: Do you remember your life?
Firbell: Of course.
I am princess Firbell of Irenhold,
daughter of queen Kirmella and heir
to the throne.
Frogman: Uh...
Isn't it more likely someone else
inherited the throne?
Considering that you're dead...
Firbell: That may be so, but until I meet such a
person, I would prefer it if you called me
by my name from when I was still alive.
Anyway, we should probably leave
before more monsters show up.
