After the lich, we...

Frogman: Firbell?
Oh. They're here again.

Torment: Missed me, Frogman? Heh heh!
Frogman: Why do you keep doing this to my friends?
Torment: Friends?! Ha ha ha! You're all my pawns!
Nothing more! Even Firbell, heh!
Frogman: What does she have to do with anything?
Torment: Oh, I'm simply the one keeping her sane.
Why, her family was so thoroughly betrayed,
it's beautiful! Ha Ha Ha!
Frogman: What are you talking about?
Torment: Didn't you figure it out? What a fool. Heh!

They're all gone! Dead! Forgotten!
Irenhold is GONE! HA HA HA HA!
Frogman: No...
Torment: Oh, stop pretending to care. Heh. As fun as
it was to gloat, it's that time again.
Time to DIE!

Frogman: You... Monster...
Torment: Get over it. You don't even know Irenhold!

Frogman: I-

Torment: I already know what you're about to say.
Keep it to yourself, it's boring! Heh!
Frogman: You can read minds?!
# Torment can't while they're alive, but he might as well troll Frogman for fun.
Torment: Why, of course! HA HA HA!
Goodbye now! And have some more power!
