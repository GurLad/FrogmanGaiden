Frogman: It's you again!
:play:Trustworthy
Torment: It IS me again, heh heh!
And you have Xirveros with you, I see!
What a lovely sight!
Frogman: What is Xirveros to do with anything?
Torment: What isn't Xirveros to do with? Ha ha!
Didn't he ever tell you?
Frogman: Tell me what?
:play:Trickster:T
Torment: He was my previous champion, yes! Heh!
Frogman: What?!
Tried to betray me at the end! It was...
Fantastic! Ha ha ha!
I broke his already fragile mind then.
Can't have you be too independent, you know
Frogman: Is this a threat?

Torment: Ooh, you're so much more interesting

Frogman: You... This... I...
Torment: See? That's much better now! Ha ha!
Maybe I should break your mind too. Hm...
Frogman: N-no! There is no need! I'll never
betray you!
Torment: HA HA HA!!! As if! But nevertheless, I do
enjoy our conversations. Heh!

You can keep your mind. For now.
