Frogman: Well, those monsters weren't that-
:play:ToTheDeath
Firbell: Oh no. We need to turn back. Now.
Frogman: Huh? Why?
Firbell: Do you see that monster there?
It is a Lich.
One of the strongest monsters around here,
capable of devastating Black Magic.
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Firbell: Because most monsters can't use it.
The Lich won't attack us unless provoked,
so we should leave-
Frogman: Then let's defeat it. It's a better goal
than endlessly wandering around.
Firbell: Are you crazy?! It is much too powerful!
Frogman: It's not like dying costs us anything...
Firbell: No, but-
Frogman: Then let's go!
Firbell: What are you doing?!
...
I can't just let you go on your own!
Oh well, time to slay a few fiends.

Frogman: That was tough. Let's get out of here now!

Firbell: Frogman, wait. We sho- uld not go that far.
Frogman: Huh? Why not?
Firbell: The deeper you go, the stronger the monsters
become.
Like that Lich we just fought.
We should stick close to where we were Born
Frogman: Sure, there might be tough enemies ahead.
But we're immortal, so we might as well
fight them.
Firbell: We could just survive as long as we can.
This is what I have done thus far.
Frogman: I'm sorry, but that sounds pointless.
Firbell: Do you want to end up like Xirveros?
Because that was what he did.
Frogman: Hm. Good point. Let's go then.
Firbell: What?! Did you not listen to a word-
And there he goes again. The fool...
