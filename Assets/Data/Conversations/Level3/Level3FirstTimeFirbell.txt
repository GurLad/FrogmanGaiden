Frogman: Well, those monsters weren't that-
:play:ToTheDeath
Firbell: Oh no. We need to turn back. Now.
Frogman: Huh? Why?
Firbell: Do you see that monster there?
It is a Lich.
One of the strongest monsters around here,
capable of devastating Black Magic.
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Firbell: Because most monsters can't use it.
The Lich won't attack us unless provoked,
so we should leave-
Frogman: Then let's defeat it. It's a better goal
than endlessly wandering around.
Firbell: Are you crazy?! It is much too powerful!
Frogman: It's not like dying costs us anything...
Firbell: No, but-
Frogman: Then let's go!
Firbell: What are you doing?!
...
(It would be dishonor- able to let him die
without assistance..)
Well, time to slay a few fiends.
