Kresla: Hey, Frogman!
Frogman: Yes?
Kresla: Do you think I could fight like the Lich?
Frogman: You know how to use magic?
Kresla: No, no, nothing like that.
I mean focusing on my skill, like you.
Frogman: Ah. All right, I guess.
Kresla: What happened to your enthusiasm?
Never mind, let's just defeat the Lich.

Kresla: Well, that was quite intense!
Let's do it again sometime!
Frogman: We probably will.
Kresla: Oh, and as for what I was saying before,
I AM going to try out different styles now.
Frogman: All right. Good luck!
