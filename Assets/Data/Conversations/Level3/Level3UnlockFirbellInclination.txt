Firbell: Frogman?
Frogman: Yes?
Firbell: I have been watching the way you fight.
The way Kresla and Xirveros fight.
I believe you have much to teach me in
that regard.
Frogman: Thank you?
Firbell: ...Let us defeat the Lich first.
Frogman: ...That was wierd.

Firbell: Well, that was quite well done.
Frogman: You helped us quite a bit.
Firbell: Nevertheless, I shall try a different
fighting style.
Frogman: Uh... why?
Firbell: I find the way you all fight intriguing.
I would like to try it as well.
Frogman: All right. As you wish.
