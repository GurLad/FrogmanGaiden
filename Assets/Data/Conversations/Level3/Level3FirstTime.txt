# === Functions ====

~ PreFirbell
:play:BeforeBattle
Frogman: Well, those monsters weren't that-
:play:ToTheDeath
Firbell: Oh no. We need to turn back. Now.
Frogman: Huh? Why?
Firbell: Do you see that monster there?
It is a Lich.
One of the strongest monsters around here,
capable of devastating Black Magic.
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Firbell: Because most monsters can't use it.
The Lich won't attack us unless provoked,
so we should leave-
Frogman: Then let's defeat it. It's a better goal
than endlessly wandering around.
Firbell: Are you crazy?! It is much too powerful!
Frogman: It's not like dying costs us anything...
Firbell: No, but-
Frogman: Then let's go!
Firbell: What are you doing?!
...
I can't just let you go on your own!
Oh well, time to slay a few fiends.

~ PreKresla
:play:BeforeBattle
Frogman: Well, those monsters weren't that-
:play:ToTheDeath
Kresla: Frogman? I hate to say this, but we must run
Now!
Frogman: Huh? Why?
Kresla: Do you see that monster there?
It's a Lich! A mighty undead wizard!
It doesn't feel pain, the cost of magic,
so it's much stronger than most monsters.
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Kresla: Because most monsters can't use it.
I don't really mind dying myself, but
most people do, so we can just-
Frogman: Then let's defeat it. It's a better goal
than endlessly wandering around.
Kresla: Oh! I like your style!
All right! Fancy dying again, then?
Frogman: No, but let's go!

~ PreXirveros
:play:BeforeBattle
Frogman: Well, those monsters weren't that-
:play:ToTheDeath
Xirveros: Frog? Bad monster here. Very bad.
Frogman: What monster?
Xirveros: Bad monster! Scary mo- nster! Magic monster!
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Xirveros: Magic rare! Magic bad! Magic painful!
Frogman: Uh... Sure...
Let's go defeat it then.
Xirveros: Frog crazy!
...
Follow frog!

~ PreAlone
:play:BeforeBattle
Frogman: I'm all alone again...
# TBA: add Kresla or Firbell (de[ending on who died)
:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: Fine. I'll do this myself.

~ PreAfterFail
:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: You again. This time, I won't lose.

~ PostFirbell
Frogman: That was tough. Let's get out of here now!
:loadMap:InitTormentRoom
:loadUnits:InitTormentRoom:player
Firbell: Frogman, wait. We sho- uld not go that far.
Frogman: Huh? Why not?
Firbell: The deeper you go, the stronger the monsters
become.
Like that Lich we just fought.
We should stick close to where we were Born
Frogman: Sure, there might be tough enemies ahead.
But we're immortal, so we might as well
fight them.
Firbell: We could just survive as long as we can.
This is what I have done thus far.
Frogman: I'm sorry, but that sounds pointless.
Firbell: Do you want to end up like Xirveros?
Because that was what he did.
Frogman: Hm. Good point. Let's go then.
Firbell: What?! Did you not listen to a word-
And there he goes again. The fool...

~ PostKresla
Frogman: That was tough. Let's get out of here now!
:loadMap:InitTormentRoom
:loadUnits:InitTormentRoom:player
Kresla: Frogman! Wait up! Before you go on, you
should know that there will be tough enemies
ahead.
Frogman: How do you know that?
Kresla: Through trial and error, of course!
The deeper you go, the stronger the monsters
That's why people like me tend to stay near
where we're Born.
Frogman: I thought that you were fearless?
Kresla: I am! Just wanted to let you know that I'm
going ahead anyway!
Frogman: Good. Me too.

~ PostXirveros
Frogman: That was tough. Let's get out of here now!
:loadMap:InitTormentRoom
:loadUnits:InitTormentRoom:player
Xirveros: Frog! Turn back. Now. This too far!
Frogman: Why would I do that?
Xirveros: They will come. You will fight.
We will die.
Frogman: Xirveros, you're not making any sense.
Xirveros: Frog, don't make my mistake.
Turn back before it's too late.
Frogman: But why? What will happen?
Xirveros: Do not listen. Do not listen. Do no listen.
Frogman: Why do I even bother? Let's just go.

~ PostGeneric
Frogman: That was tough! I'm sorry, everyone.
I'll just have to go on without you.
