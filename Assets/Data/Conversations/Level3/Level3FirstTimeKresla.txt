Kresla: Frogman? I hate to say this, but we must run
Now!
Frogman: Huh? Why?
Kresla: Do you see that monster there?

It doesn't feel pain, the cost of magic,

Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Kresla: Because most monsters can't use it.
I don't really mind dying myself, but

Frogman: Then let's defeat it. It's a better goal

Kresla: Oh! I like your style!
All right! Fancy dying again, then?
Frogman: No, but let's go!

Frogman: That was tough. Let's get out of here now!
