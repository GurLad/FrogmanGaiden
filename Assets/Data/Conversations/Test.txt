Kelik|Kelik: You, Devisian knights.
How much weight... can you handle?
Can you withstand the spirit of one who's
life has passed?
The weight of the burden of that death?

spirit...
Strong ether is like a toxin to those whose
bodies and minds are unfamiliar with such
overwhelming power...
Kain, just for a moment, grant me that
power...!
