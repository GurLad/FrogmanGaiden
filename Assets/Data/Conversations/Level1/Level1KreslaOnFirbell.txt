Kresla: Hello Frogman! Care to be my test subject?
Frogman: No, thank you. Do you have to ask this
every single time?
Kresla: Ha! No, but it's fun!
Frogman: *sigh* I've been meaning to ask.
Why is it that I never see you with Firbell?
Kresla: I have no idea, actually. I never
thought about it.
But now that you mention it, it IS
wierd. Interesting!
Frogman: My thoughts too. But we should defeat the
monsters first.
Kresla: Right, right.

Kresla: So, what do you propose we do?
Frogman: How about asking her?
Kresla: Nah, too boring. I say we ambush her!
Ohh! Maybe pretend to be monsters, and then
reveal our true identities before she
kills us! Or after!
Frogman: ...Remind me to never follow your advice.
Kresla: What?! Why? They're excellent!
All right, here this - Maybe we borrow...
Where are you going? Wait for me!
