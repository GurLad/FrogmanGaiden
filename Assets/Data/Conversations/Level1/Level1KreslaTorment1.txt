Frogman: Kresla. What was that wierd energy ball?
Kresla: Are you talking about Lich magic?\a It's very interesting indeed!\a I've found no record-
Frogman: No, not magic. A cyan, crazy thing we fought last time?
Kresla: Seems interesting! Was it a hallucination?\a What did you see?
Frogman: No, I'm certain it was real...\a Huh. They really are rather powerful...
Kresla: I've no idea what're you talking about,\a but I'd love to research that!\a Do you remember when it happened? Where?
Frogman: We have monsters to fight here, Kresla.
Kresla: Right, right, how could I forget?
