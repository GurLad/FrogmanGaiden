Frogman: Kresla. What was that wierd energy ball?
Kresla: There are no energy balls here, unless
you count Lich magic.
Frogman: No, not magic. A cyan, crazy thing we fought
last time?
Kresla: Interesting! Was it a hallucination?
What did you see?
Frogman: No, I'm certain it was real...
Huh. They really are rather powerful...
Kresla: I've no idea what you're talking about,
but I'd love to research that! Do you
remember when it happened? Where?
Frogman: We have monsters to fight here, Kresla.
Kresla: Right, right, how could I forget?

Kresla: What were we talking about?
Frogman: Never mind, Kresla. Let's just go.
Kresla: Hm... I remember it being important...
Never mind, I'll recall it eventually.
