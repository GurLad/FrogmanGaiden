# Currently, the Firbell/Kresla maps are character specific. I need to change that.

Kresla|???: I've never seen you before!
More than that, I've never seen
your KIND before! You must be new here!
Frogman: Who are you? Where's Firbell?
Kresla|???: Right, of course, where are my manners?
Kresla: My name is Kresla, a renowned scholar.
You've probably heard of me when you were
still alive.
Firbell is very inter- eseting, isn't she?
But I'm getting ahead of myself. What did
you ask again?
Frogman: Where is she. But we are surrounded
by monsters, let's deal with them first.
Kresla: Yes, yes, the boring monsters first.

Kresla: Now that's taken care of, where were we?
What are you? Where are you from?
Frogman: I, uh, don't remember.
Kresla: THAT new, huh? Interesting!
This is quite the discovery!
If only I could tell my fellow scholars!
But THOSE cowards would never come here
Anyway, did you say something?
Frogman: No, but-
Kresla: Ah, right! You wanted to know where
Firbell is!
Well, each time we return, is from a
different place, and always from Magma.
This time, you returned near me.
Last time, near Firbell.
If only I could map this place...
It's huge!
Frogman: Ah, that makes sense. Shall we leave now?
Kresla: Did I tell you about Firbell's kingdom?
That was my first discovery here!
You see, where she comes from...
Frogman: Right. I'm leaving.
Kresla: ...she still thinks... Huh? Wait for me!
