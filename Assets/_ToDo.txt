 -Bugs:
  -Intro animation stopped working (no idea why).
  -Intro palette is ruined (by Game Over one).
  -"New Knowledge" message doesn't work properly because of the MidBattleScreen rework.

 -Fix AI for 2 range units:
  -Fix find closest unit
  -Fix find which unit to attack
  -Fix find where to attack from

 -More Knowledge upgrades:
  -Rework Knowledge menu: Seperate into categories.
  -Vengeance: Frogman gains an extra stat each level-up for each dead unit (obviously unavailable on Medium)
  -Eternal Torment: Heal 1/2 HP after each turn, but monsters & Torment units gain an extra level (high risk-high reward)
  -Clear level X: Skip/replace with camp whenever you reach level X. See "On repeat maps" in Concept.
