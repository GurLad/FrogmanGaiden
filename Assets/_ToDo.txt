V-Inclination (new mechanic)
 -Knowledge (new mechanic)
Details:
-New mechanic: Inclination
 Every character has an inclination to a "stat group" (STR & END, PIR & ARM, PRE & EVA). For example, Firbell has an inclination to physical stats (STR & END),
 while Frogman to skill stats (PRE & EVA). This increases growths by 1 (assume the current growths include that +1) and gives +2 to the offensive stat when
 attacking foes of the same inclination (enemies do not get the offensive bonus unless on hard). Later on, you can change a character's inclination in events/knowledge.
-New mechanic: Knowledge
 Whenever you finish a level, you gain knowledge. This allows you to "buy" permanent upgrades between runs (think Hades' Darkness),
 and generally make the game easier over time.
